# what does the program do?


1. My program will simulate a security device similar to those installed in homes and offices. The program will read from a user-entered string and a random number-generated string to decide whether the user or the random number generated has entered the correct access code. There are two parts to this Security Device program.

2. The first part will read user input to unlock the lock if it finds the correct unlocking access code. Likewise, it will also lock the lock if it finds a valid locking code. This part of the program will output the current state, such as Lock and Unlock and give stats on the number of attempts, the number of times unlocked and the number of times locked. The program discards characters other than digits 0 through 9. As soon as the last digit of the access code is entered, my program will signal the action "State = UnLock" when the program is in the Lock state. Likewise, it will signal the action "State = Lock," when the user has entered a correct locking code while in the Unlock state. If the program is in the lock state and the user enters an incorrect unlocking code, it will also signal the action "State = Lock." Similarly, if the program is currently in the Unlock state and the user enters an incorrect locking code, it will signal the action "State = UnLock."
      * You can find the Python files related to the program's first part in the project's app folder.
      * The Python file labeled SecurityEngine.py performs all the tasks described above. Two more files extend from SecurityEngine.py.
      * The first is the test_security_engine.py which tests the methods in the   SecurityEngine.py and helps us generate unit test coverage for the first part of the program.
      * The second is InterfaceSecurityEngine.py which acts as the executable file allowing you to see the functionality of the SecurityEngine.py file and get the chance to unlock and lock the device. Here you get to interact with the program. 
 3. The second part of the program tests how long it takes to unlock the lock using a randomly generated sequence of numerical digits. First, the program generates a random number input string for the security device and tries to unlock the lock while ignoring the one-second wait time. The program runs at full speed, repeats as much as the user wants, and if no input given, defaults to five trails to produce the results: min, max, and average digits to unlock. Second, the program calculates the average time to break the lock if one has to wait one second to see if it is unlocked or not.
      * You can find the Python files related to the program's second part in the project's app folder. 
      * The Python file labeled RanNumGen.py performs all the tasks described above. Two more files extend from RanNumGen.py.
      * The first is the test_ranNumGen.py which tests the methods in the RanNumGen.py and helps us generate unit test coverage for the second part of the program.
      * The second is InterfaceRanNumGen.py which acts as the executable file allowing you to see the functionality of the RanNumGen.py file and get the chance to interact with the RanNumGen.py program. 
      
    
     
# How to build and run the executable?
1. After cloning my project repository(Security_Device) into your local directory on your test machine, please open the terminal.
2. To build and run the executable, you will need to have Python3 installed on your computer. To check if Python3 is installed, type: **python â€“version**
if not installed, please download the latest version from https://www.python.org/downloads/
3. We will not create a standalone executable of the Python scripts using the PyInstaller because that will limit user interaction. Therefore I've made two interface python files that will allow you to interact with the program and see the functionality of SecurityEngine.py and ranNumGen.py(Two primary files containing the program).
4. In the terminal, open the app folder of the cloned repo using the cd command. For example mine is:
     * **cd documents** -> **cd GitHub** -> **cd Security_Device** -> **cd app**, now type **ls** to see all the Python files in the app folder
5. To execute the InterfaceSecurityEngine.py file, type: **python InterfaceSecurityEngine.py**
     * Please follow the instructions on the screen after InterfaceSecurityEngine.py is executed. This interface will explain and show you the functionality of the first half of the program. When finished executing the file, type **clear**   
6. While still in the app folder at the terminal, type **ls** to see the files in the app. Now let us execute the InterfaceRanNumGen.py file, type: **python InterfaceRanNumGen.py**
     * Please follow the instructions on the screen after InterfaceRanNumGen.py is executed. Please allow about 30 sec for this to run. This interface will show you how a random number generator is used to unlock the engine. Here you will interact with the program to test the last half of the project.
     
7. Please repeat steps 5 and 6 as many times as you like to test and understand the program's functionality. When finished with the interface files and ready to move on to unit test coverage, type **clear** 
  

# How to generate unit test coverage?
Coverage test for Python from the terminal(linux Insturctions):  


1.  If the app folder of my project is not already opened in your terminal, open the app folder of the cloned repo using the cd command. For example, mine is:
		* **cd documents** -> **cd GitHub** -> **cd Security_Device** -> **cd app**, now type **ls** to see all the Python files in the app folder
2. pip should have been installed when you downloaded Python therfore no need to re-download, but just in case if you need it: **curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py** Then **python3 get-pip.py**
3. Type this into your terminal to install test coverage: **pip install coverage** 
4. Let us generate unit test coverage for the Security_Device.py file(AKA the first part of the project), type: **coverage run test_security_engine.py**
     * You will be asked to enter five passcodes that are given; please follow the instructions when the program runs so that we can validate every method of the SecurityEngine.py.
     After you finish running the program, To see the Coverage report of test_security_engine.py type: **coverage report**
     * The Coverage report of the test_security_engine.py should be 100% if all steps were followed as instructed in the program
5. We can repeat step 3 to see the unit test coverage for ranNumGen.py(AKA the last half of the project) 
     * Type: **coverage run test_ranNumGen.py** (side note: please wait about 80 seconds for the Coverage test to run)
     * To see the Coverage report type: **coverage report**
     * Please note the coverage for ranNum.py is 93% because we did not test a few methods of the SecurityEngine.py. We have already tested those methods in previous coverage tests.
     
6. That concludes generating unit test coverage.

# The Platform it's been tested on: 
This program was build using Python on Eclipse. The program has been test on Eclipse and the Terminal Command Line.
